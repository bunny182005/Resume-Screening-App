What is “One-vs-Rest” (OvR or One-vs-All)?\n\n👉 One-vs-Rest (OvR) is a strategy for handling multi-class classification problems\nwhen your base algorithm can only handle binary classification (yes/no).\n\nIt means:\n\nFor each class, the model learns to separate that class (One) from all the other classes (Rest).\n\n🎯 Example\n\nLet’s say your resume dataset has 3 categories:\n\nResume Category\tMeaning\n0\tData Science\n1\tIT\n2\tManagement\n\nYou want a classifier to predict which category a resume belongs to.\n\nBut KNN (and many other classifiers like Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.) are originally binary classifiers —\nthey only answer questions like:\n\n“Is this a Data Science resume (Yes/No)?”\n\nSo how do we handle 3 classes?\nThat’s where One-vs-Rest comes in.\n\n🧠 How One-vs-Rest Works\n\nIt trains one classifier per class.\n\nSo with 3 categories, you get 3 separate binary classifiers:\n\nClassifier\tWhat it learns\nModel 1\t“Is it Data Science (1) or not (0)?”\nModel 2\t“Is it IT (1) or not (0)?”\nModel 3\t“Is it Management (1) or not (0)?”\n\nThen, when you give a new resume:\n\nEach of the 3 classifiers outputs a probability score (confidence).\n\nExample:\n\nData Science → 0.7\nIT           → 0.2\nManagement   → 0.1\n\n\nThe highest score wins → final prediction = \"Data Science\".\n\n⚙️ Visualization\n\nImagine three KNN classifiers running side by side:\n\n        Resume\n           |\n  -----------------------------\n  |           |              |\nModel 1     Model 2       Model 3\n(DS vs all) (IT vs all)  (Mgmt vs all)\n  |           |              |\nScore=0.7   Score=0.2     Score=0.1\n           ↓\n   Final Prediction → \"Data Science\"\n\n💡 Why It’s Used\n\n✅ Makes binary classifiers work for multi-class problems.\n✅ Works well when classes are imbalanced.\n✅ Easy to interpret and debug.\n✅ Implemented automatically by many scikit-learn estimators.\n\n🧩 Example Code — One-vs-Rest in Action\nfrom sklearn.multiclass import OneVsRestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\nclf = OneVsRestClassifier(KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, metric='cosine'))\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\n\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n\nWhat happens internally:\n\nFor every class in y_train, it trains a separate KNN model.\n\nEach KNN learns “is it this class or not?”\n\nThen it combines all results to pick the best match.\n\n🧠 Analogy (to make it stick!)\n\nThink of One-vs-Rest like an election:\n\nEach class has its own candidate (e.g., “Data Science”, “IT”, “Management”).\n\nEach classifier “votes” for how confident it is that the input belongs to its class.\n\nThe class with the highest confidence wins the election 🏆.\n\n🧾 Quick Comparison\nStrategy\tDescription\tExample Use\nOne-vs-Rest (OvR)\t1 model per class (class vs rest)\tLogistic Regression, KNN\nOne-vs-One (OvO)\t1 model for every pair of classes\tSVM often uses this\nSoftmax (All-in-One)\tSingle model handles all classes together\tNeural
